This is a mobile web application developed using JavaScript and jQuery. It was created as a part of my Data-centric application development course in 2017 at Temple University with a specific objective in mind: to design an application for CHOP (Children's Hospital of Philadelphia) catering to patients suffering from Crohn's disease and dietitians. This was an archived version of the project, which I believe wasn't my final version due to the some forms missing data validation. 

The primary goal of this application is to empower dietitians to recommend diets, ingredients, and recipes tailored to individual patients. It boasts a responsive web design, ensuring compatibility with both mobile devices and desktop browsers.

The technologies employed in this project include HTML, CSS (utilizing the Bootstrap framework), JavaScript, with a focus on jQuery, and PHP and SQL for interfacing with the backend database.
Technologies used: 
- HTML 
- CSS (but really a framework called Bootstrap)
- JavaScript (with an emphasis on the jQuery)
- PHP (backend)
- SQL (backend)

In order to run this application, you should install the following software and configure it for local use: 
- Web Server: XAMPP (other web server software should work, but hasn't been tested).
- SQL Server: PHPmyadmin (other SQL software should work, but hasn't been tested).
- IDE: Netbeans
